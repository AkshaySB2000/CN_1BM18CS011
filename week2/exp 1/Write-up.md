<b><h1>Creating Hub and Switch topology (Learning outcomes):</h1></b><br>

When we connect one source computer from hub and another destination computer from switch, packet received at hub from the source PC is transferred to other connected device. The packet received at switch is transferred only to destination and not any other place. 
This is because the hub is a broadcasting device, it transmits the data received to all outgoing ports, while switch processes the data received, stores it and depending on the destination address, it transmits data only to 
that address rather than sending it to all outgoing ports.
