Configure router and send a ping message (Learning outcomes):

To check whether packet has been received at destination end, we make use of ping command. This shows how much data has been sent, what is total round trip time, TTL etc.
Round trip time is the time taken by a packet to travel from its source to its destination and back to its source. 
TTL expanded as Time to Live gets reduced by 1 at every node. When the TTL is 0, the packet transferred is stoppped i.e, it makes sure that packet does not stay for long in the trip.

There are 8 total interfaces, 1 for each PC and 4 for the router.

To use ping, we need to configure router first, through the terminal and also we need to assign different default gateways to the end devices.
