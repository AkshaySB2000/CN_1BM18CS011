<b><h1>Configure RIP routing protocol in routers:</h1></b><br>

<b><i>Procedure:</i></b>
<ol>
<li>A topology was created using three routers namely router0, router1 and router2 and two PCs PC0 and PC1 connected as shown in the figure.</li>
<li>Router interfaces were configured using the command: ip address address subnet_mask.</li>
<li>Encapsulation ppp and clock rates were specified as required.</li>
<li>RIP routing protocol was configured using the command: 'router rip'.</li>
</ol><br>

<b><i>Observations:</i></b>
<ol>
<li>The command show ip route shows the ip routes configured.</li>
<li>Pinging PC1 from PC0 gives the required output.</li>
</ol><br>

<b><i>Learning Outcomes:</i></b>
<ol>
<li>Creating a topology with three routers connected via serial DCE connections and 2 PCs.</li>
<li>Configuring router interfaces using encapsulation ppp and clock rate as required</li>
<li>Configuring RIP routing protocol in routers.</li>
<li>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol which uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network.</li>
<li>On proper configuration of rip routing protocol in routers, pinging gives the required response.</li>
</ol>
